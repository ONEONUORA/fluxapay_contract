# PR: Add NatSpec-style Documentation and CI Documentation Check

## 📝 Description

This PR addresses issue #52 by adding comprehensive NatSpec-style (///) doc comments to all public functions in the core contract files. It also adds a documentation validity check to the CI pipeline to ensure future contributions maintain this standard.

The goal is to improve developer experience and ensure that generated TypeScript bindings have proper inline documentation.

## ✅ Technical Requirements Fulfilled

- Added Rust doc comments (///) to all `pub fn` in:
  - `lib.rs` (RefundManager, PaymentProcessor, format_id)
  - `merchant_registry.rs` (MerchantRegistry)
  - `access_control.rs` (AccessControl and Role definitions)
- Documented:
  - Purpose/Description
  - Parameters
  - Return values
  - Authorization requirements
  - Potential errors
- Added `cargo doc --no-deps --all-features` check to the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` lint job.

## 🧪 Verification Results

- **Documentation Generation**: Verified locally with `cargo doc --no-deps --all-features`. All documentation generated successfully.
- **Automated Tests**: Ran `cargo test --verbose --all-features`. Result: `41 passed; 0 failed`.
- **Merge-Safe**: No functional logic was modified; changes are limited to doc comments and CI configuration.
